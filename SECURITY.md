# Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in AuraStream, please follow the disclosure guidance below.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Preferred method:
- Open a private GitHub Security Advisory for this repository (recommended).
- If that's not available, create a new issue **labeled** `security` and do NOT include exploit details or PoC in a public issue.

When reporting, please include:
- Affected component(s) and version(s).
- A concise description of the issue and the potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce (in a private disclosure or to a maintainer).
- Suggested mitigation (if any).
- Your contact information for follow-up.

## Our response process

- We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days.
- We may request additional information or a private proof-of-concept to validate.
- We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure and release of a patched version.

## Public disclosure
Do not publicly disclose the issue before we publish a fix or a coordinated disclosure. Coordinated disclosure helps avoid exploitation before a patch is available.

## Security contacts
- Primary contact: repository maintainers via GitHub (open a private Security Advisory or label an issue `security`).
- If you require an alternate contact method, please include instructions in your report.

Thank you for helping keep AuraStream secure.
